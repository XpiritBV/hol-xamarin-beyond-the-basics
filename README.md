# HOL Workshop - Xamarin Beyond the Basics

In this workshop, we'll explore developing scenarios with Xamarin that are beyond the basics. For reference, see our [introductory HOL workshop about Xamarin](https://github.com/XpiritBV/xamarin-hands-on-labs).

## Setup

To get the most out of this Hands-On Lab, please take your time to prepare your machine ahead of the conference. Especially the Android SDK is a large download, which is very hard to download over conference WiFi. The most comprehensive way to get ready is to complete the steps in Microsoftâ€™s Getting Started tutorial online at:

You can participate with either a Windows developer PC or a Mac. Do make sure that you create a blank Xamarin solution and try to run the app in an emulator or on your physical mobile device.

## HOL01 - Advanced Xamarin.Forms

This module introduces new features introduced in Xamarin.Forms: `Visual`, `CollectionView` and `Shell`. Additionally, we will add an automatic Dark Mode to an existing Forms Application.

## HOL03 - Resilient Connected Apps

In this module, we will add some mechisms to the app so that it is more resilient in dealing with flaky network connections.

## HOL06 - Tapping into Native Experiences
