# HOL Workshop - Xamarin Beyond the Basics

In this workshop, we'll explore developing scenarios with Xamarin that are beyond the basics. For reference, see our [introductory HOL workshop about Xamarin](https://github.com/XpiritBV/xamarin-hands-on-labs).

## Setup

To get the most out of this Hands-On Lab, please take your time to prepare your machine ahead of the conference. Especially the Android SDK is a large download, which is very hard to download over conference WiFi. The most comprehensive way to get ready is to complete the steps in Microsoftâ€™s Instaling Xamarin tutorial online at:
 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/index
 
You can participate with either a Windows developer PC or a Mac. Do make sure that you create a blank Xamarin solution and try to run the app in an emulator or on your physical mobile device.

## Exercise 1 - Advanced Xamarin.Forms

This module introduces new features introduced in Xamarin.Forms: `Visual`, `CollectionView` and `Shell`. Additionally, we will add an automatic Dark Mode to an existing Forms Application.
