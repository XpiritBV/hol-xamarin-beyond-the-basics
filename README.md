# HOL Workshop - Xamarin Beyond the Basics

In this workshop, we'll explore developing scenarios with Xamarin that are beyond the basics. For reference, see our [introductory HOL workshop about Xamarin](https://github.com/XpiritBV/xamarin-hands-on-labs).

## HOL01 - Advanced Xamarin.Forms

This module introduces new features introduced in Xamarin.Forms: `Visual`, `CollectionView` and `Shell`. Additionally, we will add an automatic Dark Mode to an existing Forms Application.
