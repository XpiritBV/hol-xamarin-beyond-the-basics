# HOL Workshop - Xamarin Beyond the Basics

In this workshop, we'll explore developing scenarios with Xamarin that are beyond the basics. For reference, see our [introductory HOL workshop about Xamarin](https://github.com/XpiritBV/xamarin-hands-on-labs).

## Setup

In order to get the most out of this workshop, please make sure that your developer machine is prepared. Follow the installation tutorial on the [Xamarin.com](www.xamarin.com) homepage, and make sure that you can launch a new Xamarin.Forms project from Visual Studio in either iOS or Android.

## HOL01 - Advanced Xamarin.Forms

This module introduces new features introduced in Xamarin.Forms: `Visual`, `CollectionView` and `Shell`. Additionally, we will add an automatic Dark Mode to an existing Forms Application.

## HOL03 - Resilient Connected Apps

In this module, we will add some mechisms to the app so that it is more resilient in dealing with flaky network connections.

## HOL06 - Tapping into Native Experiences
