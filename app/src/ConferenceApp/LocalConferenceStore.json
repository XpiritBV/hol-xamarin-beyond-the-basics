We remove abstractions, complex structures, and focus building on the axis of change, then what's next? What new structures, patterns, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures, and dive into the patterns, tools, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems, from desktop, SPA, and normal MVC applications. Finally, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.",

    "description": "In this session, Steve will introduce gRPC, a modern high-performance RPC framework for inter-service communication. We'll look at how gRPC stacks up against existing REST-based communication and explore the benefits this technology has to offer. gRPC uses HTTP/2 as its transport protocol and ProtoBuf encoded content for efficient, fast communication.\r\n\r\nYou'll see C# examples of how to build client and server gRPC components using ASP.NET Core 3.0, using the blazingly fast Kestrel web server. You'll learn how to define your proto3 service definition (contract) and integrate with MSBuild tooling to code gen the server and client components you'll need. You'll be amazed at how quickly a service can be created with little effort or boilerplate code required. You'll also see how additional clients can easily be generated for other languages such as Node.js to make connecting polyglot systems a breeze.\r\n\r\nIt's a great time to begin taking notice of gRPC as a worthy contender to take over from REST for inter-service communication in microservice-based environments. It's time we started to let service talk their own language!",

You might be able to tell from log information and telemetry data, but why not have them tell you how healthy they are themselves? ASP.NET Core 2.2 introduces health endpoints that let your apps and APIs do just that. In this session you will learn how to make health checks an integral part of your solution. We will cover various types of health checks ranging from internal status, such as memory thresholds, to health based on external dependencies, such as databases and HTTP endpoints. Finally, you are going to see how this all can be used in a Docker container cluster to allow the orchestrator to check for liveliness and readiness based on your health endpoints.",

    "description": "In this intensive demo-packed session, you’ll learn how to write applications for Cosmos DB, and see how to work with the various Cosmos DB APIs. These APIs support a variety of data models, including the SQL and MongoDB APIs (for JSON documents), Table API for (key-value entities), Gremlin API (for graphs) and Cassandra (for columnar). Regardless what you choose as a data model of choice, you’ll learn how to provision throughput, and how to partition and globally distribute your data to deliver massive scale.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see how to migrate data from SQL Server to Cosmos DB, and how to write queries using Cosmos DB SQL. Then we’ll write data access code that creates and queries databases, collections, and documents. We’ll also create, deploy, and execute server-side stored procedures, triggers and user-defined functions, using the Cosmos DB server-side programming model. Attend this session, and prepare to build Cosmos DB applications today!\r\n",

    "description": "To really understand what our users need so that we can build the right thing, we want to have a first-hand experience of 'real-life stories' before we model and create our software. To quote Alberto Brandolini \"it is not the domain expert's knowledge that goes into production, it is the developer's assumption of that knowledge that goes into production\". EventStorming is a visual technique that minimizes assumptions by engaging in collaborative deliberate learning across different disciplines. This helps to solve complex business problems in the most effective way.\r\n \r\nAlthough the learning of the domain helps us to understand the domain better, EventStorming can be quite an overwhelming experience. Developers can be left with the question of how to turn a few stickies on a wall into working code.\r\n \r\nJoin us in this talk in which we show the basic principles of EventStorming. We will cover the different forms of EventStorming and in which situation they best can be applied. During a live EventStorming software modelling session, we will show how you can leverage Domain-Driven Design patterns that will ultimately result in coding TDD (Test Driven Development) style!\r\n",

How do you know? Traditional monitoring tools are dead. They can't give you the insights you need to see if your distributed system is still working or not.\r\n\r\n\"Observability driven development\" is a way to focus on building observable systems that focus on seeing if your system is actually working and delivering value to your customers.\r\n\r\nBy being able to observe your production environment you are able to learn from it, experiment on it (in production) and in the end improve it. In this session we'll discuss what it means to create observable systems and how you can start adding observability to your own systems which help everyone from developers to product owners to make better decisions in adding value to their software.",

    "description": "GraphQL is making a huge splash in modern serverless applications. GraphQL allows you to present custom apis that allow the consumer of the API to decide what information they want and how it should be shaped. It also allows for real time pushes of data using web sockets and subscriptions. In this talk, you will learn how to implement this powerful API in the cloud using serverless functions in Azure. You will learn how the GraphQL query language works and how to shape data to suit your needs. You will see push notifications in action with Subscriptions and understand the different ways to manipulate data. Come learn how to reinvent the way you think about APIs and build realtime serverless APIs with GraphQL",

With the ever-increasing volume and variety of data, this can easily start to feel like a daunting task.\r\n\r\nAzure Data Factory (ADF) is a hybrid data integration service that lets you build, orchestrate and monitor complex and scalable data pipelines - without writing any code. The first version of Azure Data Factory may not have lived entirely up to its nickname \"SSIS in the Cloud\", but the second version has been drastically improved and expanded with new capabilities.\r\n\r\nBut wait, what's that? You have already invested years and millions in a comprehensive SSIS solution, you say? No problem! You can lift and shift your existing SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory to start modernizing your solution while retaining the investments you have already made.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will first go through the fundamentals of Azure Data Factory and see how easy it is to build new data pipelines or migrate your existing SSIS packages. Then, we will explore some of the major improvements in Azure Data Factory v2, including the new Mapping Data Flows.

In this talk we will go through Managed Identities for Azure Resources, how they work, and how you can use them to use Azure services in a secure way without having to manage any keys yourself. We will go through a demo application which uses various Azure services through a managed identity, removing the need to use keys entirely.

    "description": "The Vikings came from the land of ice and snow, from the midnight sun, where the hot springs flow. In addition to longships and bad attitudes, they had a system of writing that we, in modern times, have dubbed the Younger Futhark (or ᚠᚢᚦᚬᚱᚴ if you're a Viking). These sigils are more commonly called runes and have been mimicked in fantasy literature and role-playing games for decades.\r\n\r\nOf course, having an alphabet, runic or otherwise, solves lots of problems. But, it also introduces others. The Vikings had the same problem we do today. How were they to get their automated software systems to recognize the hand-carved input of a typical boatman? Of course, they were never able to solve this problem and were instead forced into a life of burning and pillaging. Today, we have deep learning and neural networks and can, fortunately, avoid such a fate.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we are going to build a Convolution Neural Network to recognize hand-written runes from the Younger Futhark. We'll be using Keras to write easy to understand Python code that creates and trains the neural network to do this. We'll wire this up to a web application using Flask and some client-side JavaScript so you can write some runes yourself and see if it recognizes them.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll understand how Convolution Neural Networks work, how to build your own using Python and Keras, and how to make it a part of an application using Flask. Maybe you'll even try seeing what it thinks of the Bluetooth logo?",

    "title": "An Introduction to WebAssembly",
    "description": "Want to write a web application? Better get familiar with JavaScript! JavaScript has long been the king of front-end. While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and *you* still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly. So grab a non-JavaScript language, a modern browser, and let's and get started!",

    "description": "Your organization has successfully deployed Kubernetes, migrated a few applications, and is seeing a positive return on investment. In fact, the benefit of running applications on Kubernetes has been so apparent, multiple teams within your organization are now also interested in embracing Kubernetes. Expanding adoption is exciting, however, is your organization ready to safely and efficiently manage Kubernetes in a multi-tenant configuration?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will discuss and demonstrate multiple methods for enforcing governance in a Kubernetes cluster. Topics will include:\r\n\r\n\t- Securing access to the Kubernetes cluster API server\r\n\t- Securing and rationing Kubernetes compute resources\r\n\t- Controlling application configuration and acceptance criteria\r\n\t- Providing quality of service for critical workload\r\n\t- Mechanisms for chargeback\r\n\r\nThe goal of this session is to not only highlight concepts for securing and effective use of cluster resources, but to demonstrate the technical components that enable governance in Kubernetes. As a result of attending this session you will be better prepared to consider and implement policy driven governance in a Kubernetes cluster.",

For over 50 years Moore’s Law has described persistent exponential growth in computational power, but physical limitations have slowed that trend. Advancement now comes through the use of multiple CPUs and cores. This is fine for languages featuring threads and task-based architectures. But what about JavaScript?\r\n\r\nThankfully, new paradigms handle parallelism over the web. Web Worker constructs allow long-running code to execute in the background without blocking the UI. Shared Memory and Atomic operations allow true sharing of data among worker processes.

    "description": "Debugging is a game of strategy. The rules are set by the computer, your debugger, and requirements or user expectations. You may enter the contest expecting a trivial opponent, only to find it like Hydra with two new problems sprouting for each one you solve. It’s a critical game because we fix bugs from the time we first check in code, and the cost of each bug tends to increase across the project lifecycle. In this talk, you’ll learn about debugging strategies that help you ask better questions in order to significantly reduce the amount of time you spend debugging. Poor performance can be a bug, and you’ll learn straightforward profiling techniques to help you understand performance problems. Core debugging principles covered in this talk apply across most languages and platforms; the demonstrations will use Visual Studio 2017. Leave this talk ready to formulate ideas into testable strategies you can use to resolve bugs faster and with more confidence.",

However questions remain around concept and implementation, especially when you start to compare how we've built systems in the past, and what serverless offers us now. Is Serverless the future, or just the emperor's new clothes?\r\nThis talk will very briefly introduce serverless computing, but will then dive into some of the questions that aren't always asked in conjunction with this technology. Topics will include:\r\n-How does your attitude to security change?\r\n-Is it easier, or harder, to create reliable, resilient systems?\r\n-Do patterns like Circuit breakers and connection pools make sense any more?\r\n-Is vendor lock-in a problem?\r\n-Is serverless computing only for microservice architectures?\r\n-Which problems fit serverless computing?\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk you should have a firm grasp of what serverless computing really can offer, cut through some of the hype, and get an understanding about where and how you can use it in your own organisations.",

Join us during this session and walk out with a well-filled toolbox ready to get sh*t done with Azure Functions!\r\n\r\nRunning Azure Functions in AKS, or any other Kubernetes deployment, is very well possible. But be prepared for a few pitfalls. We will show you these pitfalls, and how to avoid them.\r\n\r\nIf you use Managed Identities, your applications will be more secure. We'll tell you why, our demos will show you how! We'll use Managed Identities to securely connect to other Azure resources like Azure Key Vault.\r\n\r\nAzure Functions V 2.x now supports Dependency Injection, leveraging the ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection features. We will show you how to configure and use DI.",

One reason is that a DDD implementation quite varies depending on your domain and culture. However, it is still possible to provide some explicit rules those can help you while designing your code base.\r\n\r\nThis talk starts by introducing the DDD and providing a layering model based on the DDD and the Clean Architecture. It then introduces the core building blocks (like Aggregates, Repositories, Domain Services, DTOs… etc) of an application built on the DDD principles.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the talk, it shows some strict coding rules for the core building blocks with real code examples and suggestions. These rules are essential to build a large scale application implements DDD patterns & practices.\r\n\r\nWhile the solution structure and code samples are based on .NET and C#, the talk is useful for developers and architects working with any server side technology.\r\n",

Unfortunately, with microservices, there is no well-described recipe that will take you directly to your desired end state. So, with a small team Sander Hoogendoorn, chief architect at Quby, ventured off to and is trying to navigate through the many big and small decisions you need to make when moving towards a microservices technology on a daily basis. During this interactive talk, Sander will take you through the small steps Quby has made, illustrating many of these architectural, design and frameworks decisions made, along the way, with real code examples in Typescript, slowly arriving at a happy state and a set of patterns and coding techniques that evolved along the way.\r\n\r\nSander not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well. If your company or organization is also underway towards a microservices architecture, and continuous delivery, be sure to visit this talk, as you too will have to answer many of the questions Sander and his team are facing, and have faced in earlier successful implementations.",

Nine months of late nights and lost weekends later, we launched it! The problem: no one cared.\r\n\r\nA brilliant project isn't enough. I had to spread my vision, which was difficult for a developer like me. I learned quickly that even the best ideas needed to be sold. I had to build an audience, tell a story, and win over customers.

What seems like a simple requirement can quickly become complicated! Networks aren't reliable and services fail. Dealing with those inevitable facts and avoiding a cascading failure can be quite a challenge. In this talk, Steve will explore how we can build .NET Core applications that make HTTP requests and rely on downstream services, whilst remaining resilient and fault tolerant.\r\n\r\nThis session will focus on some of the improvements which have been released in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.1, such as IHttpClientFactory and the new, more performant socket-based handler. Steve will identify some HTTP anti-patterns and common mistakes and demonstrate how we can refactor existing code to use the new HttpClientFactory features.\r\n\r\nNext, Steve will demonstrate Polly; a fantastic resilience and transient fault handling library which can be used to make your applications less prone to failure. When integrated with the Microsoft HttpClientFactory; wrapping your HTTP calls in retries, timeouts and circuit-breakers has never been easier!\r\n\r\nIf you're building services which make HTTP calls, then this talk is for you!",

    "title": "An AI with an Agenda: How Our Cognitive Biases Leak Into Machine Learning",
    "description": "In the glorious AI-assisted future, all decisions are objective and perfect, and there’s no such thing as cognitive biases. That’s why we created AI and machine learning, right? Because humans can make mistakes, and computers are perfect. Well, there’s some bad news: humans make those AIs and machine learning models, and as a result humanity’s biases and missteps can subtly work their way into our AI and models.\r\n\r\nAll hope isn’t lost, though! In this talk you’ll learn how science and statistics have already solved some of these problems and how a robust awareness of cognitive biases can help with many of the rest. Come learn what else we can do to protect ourselves from these old mistakes, because we owe it to the people who’ll rely on our algorithms to deliver the best possible intelligence!",
