# Excersise 04, Add notifications to your app

In this lab you will add local notifications to your app using the Shiny.Location NuGet package. We will create notifications that will trigger on location based information using geofensing and we will create notifications that are time based. More or less reminders without the use of the calendar, which we used in the previous excersises.

Goals for this lab: 
- [Setup the app to use additional Shiny NuGEt Packages](#1)
- [Create notifications based on time](#2)
- [Add notifications to the background service](#3)
- [Add remote content to the notification](#4)
